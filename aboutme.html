    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>In my life I have little to few few things that bring me joy and that goes as far as my faith my family and football, In my life I want to pursue an NFL career. I am working towards these goals by perfecting my craft even during the offseason, running track to increase speed, lifting weights to increase strength and watching film to increase knowledge about the game. I feel like if I want to achieve the goal that I set out for I have to work everyday and always work harder because someone out there wants the same dream I seek.Â In the near future I want to hold multiple Power5 division one offers for football, graduate high and help my community grow as a whole. I want to be known as one of those first guys in last to leave kind of guys, I also want to be known for my gratitude and me being a positive role model in my city</p>
